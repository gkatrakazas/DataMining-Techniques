## Introduction

Data mining is a crucial field in machine learning and data science, involving the discovery of patterns, insights, and knowledge within large datasets. This repository aims to provide practical implementations of several data mining techniques, enabling you to leverage them for various tasks. Here's an overview of what you'll find:

## Text Classification

Text classification is a common natural language processing (NLP) task, where the goal is to categorize text documents into predefined classes or labels. In the `text_classification` directory, you'll find code and examples for:

- Text preprocessing, including cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- Training and evaluation of different machine learning models for text classification, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Neural Networks.
- Saving and loading trained models for future use.
- A guide on how to apply these techniques to your text classification problems.

## Nearest Neighbor Search with LSH

Nearest neighbor search is a fundamental operation in data mining, and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a technique to efficiently find approximate nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces. In the `nearest_neighbor_lsh` directory, you'll explore:

- Implementation and comparison of LSH-based similarity search with brute-force methods.
- Experiments using Jaccard and Cosine similarity measures.
- Parameter tuning to balance accuracy and computation time.
- An understanding of LSH and its applications in recommendation systems, image retrieval, and more.

## Time Series Similarity

Time series data is prevalent in various domains, and measuring similarity between time series is essential for tasks like anomaly detection and pattern recognition. In the `time_series_similarity` directory, you'll delve into:

- The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for computing the similarity between time series data.
- Efficient Python implementations of DTW and how it can be applied to real-world scenarios.
- Evaluation of DTW on time series datasets.
- Guidance on incorporating DTW into your time series analysis projects.
